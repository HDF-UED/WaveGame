UE5 Wave Game Development Repo

This is a git repo for a small vampire-survivors-like wave game im making soley to develop my skills in ue5.
A secondary reason to make this project is so i have something to play during breaks between lessons on the university computers, we cant intall our own software because of the AUP, but we can definitly use software thats already on these computers, which includes ue5 as
this is a games development course

This game is never intended to be sold or distributed widely and as such i am not now and likely will never be looking for bug reports, however if you find this project and want to give me some generic advice on UE5 development id appreicate it, no obligation to do so
however
